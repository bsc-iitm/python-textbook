# Lesson 3.6

## Math and Programming

Before closing this chapter, let us spend some time at the intersection of mathematics and programming.

### Limits

Consider the following number:

$$
\sqrt{2} - 1
$$

It is known that $1 < \sqrt{2} < 2$. From this, it follows that $0 < \sqrt{2} - 1 < 1$. Now, consider the following sequence:

$$
a_n = \left( \sqrt{2} - 1 \right)^n
$$

As $n$ becomes very large, the values in this sequence will become smaller and smaller. This is because, if you keep multiplying a fraction with itself, it keeps getting smaller. In mathematical terms, the limit of this sequence as $n$ tends to infinity is zero. Let us verify this programmatically:

<!-- Replace this with a repl -->

```python linenums="1"
import math
n = int(input())				# sequence length
CONST = math.pow(2, 0.5) - 1	# basic term in the sequence
a_n = 1							# zeroth term
for i in range(n):
    a_n = a_n * CONST			# computing the nth term
print(a_n)
```

Try this out for a few values of $n$. For $n = 100$, the value is $5.27 \times 10^{-39}$, which is so small that for all practical purposes, it is as good as zero. 

### Recurrence relation

Now, here is another fact. For every number $n$, there are unique integers $x$ and $y$ such that:
$$
(\sqrt{2} - 1)^n = x + y \cdot \sqrt{2}
$$
For $n = 1$, this is obvious: $x = -1, y = 1$. What about higher values of $n$? . We can prove this using mathematical induction. The following is a sketch of the inductive proof. If we have that $(\sqrt{2} - 1)^n = x_n + y_n \cdot \sqrt{2}$, then:

$$
\begin{align}
(\sqrt{2} - 1)^{n + 1} &= (x_n + y_n \cdot \sqrt{2}) \cdot (\sqrt{2} - 1) \\
&= (2y_n - x_n) + (x_n - y_n) \cdot \sqrt{2} \\
&= x_{n + 1} + y_{n + 1} \cdot \sqrt{2}
\end{align}
$$

The equation given above defines what is called a recurrence relation: each new term in the sequence is a function of it's preceding term (or terms). In this sequence we have $x_1 = -1, y_1 = 1$. For $n > 0$, the pair of equations given below forms the recurrence relation:

$$
\begin{align}
x_{n + 1} &= 2 y_n - x_n \\
y_{n + 1} &= x_n - y_n
\end{align}
$$

Loops are useful tools when it comes to computing terms in such sequences:

```python linenums="1"
n = int(input())	# sequence length
x_n, y_n = -1, 1	# x_1 and y_1
for i in range(n - 1):
    x_n, y_n = 2 * y_n - x_n, x_n - y_n
```

### Rational Approximation

This in turn provides a way to approximate $\sqrt{2}$ using rational numbers:
$$
\sqrt{2} \approx \frac{-x_n}{y_n}
$$
As $n$ becomes large, this approximation will become increasingly accurate. For example, here is an approximation after 100 iterations. It is accurate up to several decimal places!
$$
\frac{228725309250740208744750893347264645481}{161733217200188571081311986634082331709}
$$
Is any of this useful? Well, not all things we learn need to be useful. Sometimes we learn things just because they seem interesting and because we are curious. _And sometimes curiosity might just be the spark that ignites innovation._
