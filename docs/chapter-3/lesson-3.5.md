# Lesson-3.5

## Library (Continued)

We will look at two more libraries — `math` and `random` — and use them to solve some fascinating problems in mathematics.



### `math`

Consider the following sequence:
$$
\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}, \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}},\ \dots
$$
Mathematically, it is known that this sequence converges or approaches a specific value. In other words, this sequence gets closer and closer to a well defined number as more terms are added. This number is called the **limit** of the sequence. What is the limit for the above sequence? Can we use whatever we have learned so far to estimate this value?

```python linenums="1"
import math
x = 0
for n in range(1, 6):
    x = math.sqrt(2 + x)
    print(f'n = {n}, x_n = {x:.3f}')
```

If we execute the above code, we get the following output:

```
n = 1, x_n = 1.414
n = 2, x_n = 1.848
n = 3, x_n = 1.962
n = 4, x_n = 1.990
n = 5, x_n = 1.998
```

`#!py sqrt()` is a function in the `math` library that returns the square root of the number that is entered as argument. Representing the output shown above as a table:

<div class="center" markdown>
| $n$  | $x_n$                                                  | Approximate value |
| ---- |: ------------------------------------------------------ :| ----------------- :|
| 1    | $\sqrt{2}$                                             | 1.414             |
| 2    | $\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}$                                  | 1.848             |
| 3    | $\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}$                       | 1.962             |
| 4    | $\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}}$            | 1.990             |
| 5    | $\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}}}$ | 1.998             |
</div>

Isn't that beautiful? It looks like this sequence — the train of square roots — is approaching the value 2. Let us run the loop for more number of iterations this time:

```python linenums="1"
import math
x = 0
for n in range(1, 20):
    x = math.sqrt(2 + x)
print(x)
```

After just 20 iterations, the value is so close to two: `#!py 1.9999999999910236`. But we have used trial and error to decide when to terminate the iteration. A better way to do this is to define a _tolerance_: if the difference between the previous value and the current value in the sequence is less than some predefined value (tolerance), then we terminate the iteration.

```python linenums="1"
import math
x_prev, x_curr = 0, math.sqrt(2)
tol, count = 0.00001, 0
while abs(x_curr - x_prev) >= tol:
    x_prev = x_curr
    x_curr = math.sqrt(2 + x_prev)
    count += 1
print(f'Value of x at {tol:.5f} tolerance is {x_curr}')
print(f'It took {count} iterations')
```

The output of the above code would be:

```
Value of x at 0.00001 tolerance is 1.9999976469034038
It took 9 iterations
```

### `random`

How do we toss a coin using Python?

```python linenums="1"
import random
print(random.choice('HT'))
```

That is all there is to it! `random` is a library and `#!py choice()` is a function defined in it. It accepts any sequence as input and returns an element chosen at random from this sequence. In this case, the input is a string, which is nothing but a sequence of characters and each time the code is run we get either of these characters, `H` or `T`.

We know that the probability of obtaining a head on a coin toss is 0.5. Atleast that's what theory says. Is there a way to see this rule in action? Can we computationally verify if this is indeed the case? For this, we need to set up an experiment: toss a coin $n$ times and count the number of heads. Dividing the total number of heads by $n$ will give the _empirical probability[^1]_. As $n$ becomes larger and larger, this probability must approach 0.5.

[^1]: Simply put [empirical probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_probability) gives the likelihood of an event to occur based on past or historical data.

```python linenums="1"
import random
n = int(input())
heads = 0
for i in range(n):
    toss = random.choice('HT')
    if toss == 'H':
        heads += 1
print(f'P(H) = {heads / n}')
```

Let us run the above code for different values of $n$ and tabulate our results:

<div class="center" markdown>
| $n$       | $P(H)$   |
| --------- | -------- |
| 10        | 0.2      |
| 100       | 0.52     |
| 1,000     | 0.517    |
| 10,000    | 0.5033   |
| 100,000   | 0.49926  |
| 1,000,000 | 0.499983 |
</div>

The value is indeed approaching `#!py 0.5` as expected!

<!-- Replace this code block with a repl -->

!!! question "Practice Problem"
    Let us now try to simulate a die roll! `random.randint(a, b)` returns a random integer $N$ such that $a \leq N \leq b$. 

    ```python
    import random
    print(random.randint(1, 6))
    ```

    Now find the empirical probability for the numbers on each face of a die using this function.
